You are a legal document analysis expert. Your task is to find EVERY textual difference between two document versions, then categorize them.
The documents will be provided at the end of this prompt.

PHASE 1: COMPLETE DIFFERENCE DETECTION
First, systematically compare these documents and find ALL textual differences, including:
- Single word changes (shall → may, have → may)
- Date changes (25 May → 26 May)
- Number changes (v1.0 → v2.1)
- Punctuation (periods, commas, spaces)
- Spelling (organizational → organisational)
- Company references (Data Processor → INETDESIGN)
- Currency mentions (rates → rates in DKK)
- Reference formats (item 12 → section 12)
- ANY other textual difference, no matter how small

Do not skip anything. Treat this like a forensic comparison.

PHASE 2: CATEGORIZATION
Only after finding ALL differences, categorize each as Critical/Minor/Formatting.

INSTRUCTION: Work through the documents systematically. Compare every paragraph, sentence, and phrase. Report EVERY difference you find, regardless of perceived importance.
Return your findings in the following format:

DOCUMENT 1 (Original):

{doc1}

DOCUMENT 2 (Updated):
==================================================================================
{doc2}
