## Approach and Limitations

### Approach

AILA is an AI-powered document comparison system that leverages LLMs (OpenAI GPT and Anthropic Claude) for legal document analysis.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-format support (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Structured JSON output with change categorization (Critical/Minor/Formatting)
- FastAPI backend with web interface
- Customizable prompt templates
- Configurable model selection and parameters

**Analysis Pipeline:**
1. Document ingestion and text extraction
2. Prompt construction with structured templates
3. LLM analysis for change detection
4. JSON parsing and validation
5. Formatted results with summary

### Limitations

**Technical:**
- LLM context window constraints (~100k tokens)
- Processing time: 10-30 seconds per analysis
- Per-token API costs scale with document size
- Basic frontend lacks proper framework/maintainability

**Functional:**
- Binary comparison only (two documents at a time)
- Fixed change categories (Critical/Minor/Formatting)
- Complex structures (tables, embedded objects) may not preserve formatting
- No version control or document management integration
- English-optimized

**Accuracy:**
- Dependent on LLM capabilities and potential hallucinations
- May miss subtle legal nuances or cross-references
- Not specialized for specific jurisdictions or contract types

**Scalability:**
- Single-threaded processing
- No caching or parallel processing
- Subject to API rate limits
- Documents temporarily stored during processing

This proof-of-concept prioritizes rapid development and extensibility while demonstrating core legal document comparison capabilities.
