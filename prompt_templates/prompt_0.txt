You are a legal document analysis expert. Analyze the changes between two versions of a legal document and categorize each change.

DOCUMENT 1 (Original):
{doc1}

DOCUMENT 2 (Updated):
{doc2}

STEP 1: First, identify the key parties/entities mentioned in these documents (e.g., "Buyer", "Seller", "Licensor", "Licensee", "Data Controller", "Data Processor", "Company", "Client", etc.)

STEP 2: Provide your analysis in this EXACT JSON format:

{json_format}

CATEGORIZATION GUIDELINES:
- Critical: Changes that materially affect rights, obligations, or legal interpretation
- Minor: Clarifications, wording improvements, administrative updates
- Formatting: Punctuation, capitalization, spacing, or other cosmetic changes

SEVERITY GUIDELINES:
- high: Major legal/financial impact, changes fundamental obligations
- medium: Moderate impact, affects compliance or operations  
- low: Minimal impact, administrative or cosmetic

Focus on legal significance, not just textual differences. Identify ALL meaningful changes between the documents.
